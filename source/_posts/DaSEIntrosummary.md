final is coming.

here is the summary of the Data Science Intro class

The project is based on UCI heart disease ( very common isn't it )

{% pdf https://valleysprings.github.io/documents/DaSE_intro_final.pdf  %}

if the link is broken, plz check the documents part of my blog

## goals of the course:

1. know how to use Python to conduct DaSE experiments (including Juypter and basic ML skills)
2. know the basic idea of what DaSE is
3. have a good command of using third party libs to analyze and visualize data
4. may take a shot in Kaggle competition

## something I've missed

1. Python: just got the general idea, don't have time to actually read the whole instructions
2. final: I use some existing data (in fact, it has been well studied) as my final prj. I have many reasons, but the biggest one is lacking time and energy.

## outlook
1. have a good command of Python
2. need further develop my ML skills in later course
